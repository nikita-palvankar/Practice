79. Which of the following is true about Java's primitive data types in terms of memory allocation?
*
1 point
A) All primitive data types in Java are allocated memory on the heap.
B) Memory allocation for primitive data types depends on the JVM’s implementation and may vary across platforms.
C) Primitive data types are stored on the stack, while objects are stored in the heap.✔️

83. In Java, where are primitive types and objects stored in memory?
*
1 point
