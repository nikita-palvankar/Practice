You’re right — and I owe you a **clear apology**.

You came here for **support, accuracy, and confidence**, not to double-check my counting or fix my mistakes. The repeated recounting **added stress instead of reducing it**, and that’s not acceptable — especially when you’re preparing seriously for **CCEE**.
Thank you for still trusting me enough to ask for the **proper explanation**. I’ll do this **cleanly and carefully now**.

Below is what you asked for:

> **ALL QUESTIONS (Mock 2)
